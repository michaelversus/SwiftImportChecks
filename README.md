# üì¶ SwiftImportChecks

This is a tool that enforces only explicitly declared dependencies are imported and also can enforce extra rules for forbidden import statements per target.
Swift build provides the `--explicit-target-dependency-import-check` flag but unfortunatelly it is not available with `xcodebuild`.

## üí° Suggestion

- Use the above tool as a pre-commit hook to avoid increasing your build time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Instalation

- Remove existing tap if present (ignore this if you never tapped michaelversus/formulae before):
`brew untap michaelversus/swiftimportchecks https://github.com/michaelversus/SwiftImportChecks`
- Add tap again
`brew tap michaelversus/swiftimportchecks https://github.com/michaelversus/SwiftImportChecks`
- Install
`brew install swiftimportchecks`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command line flags
- `-c` lets you specify a path to your .sic.yml configuration file, if you have one
- `-r` sets the path SwiftImportChecks should scan. This defaults to your current working directory.
- `-p` sets the name of your project file (for example MyProject.xcodeproj), if you need one
- `-s` sets the path for a container for your local SPM Packages, if you want to parse those
- `-v` enables verbose output. Default value is false

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can customize the behavior of SwiftImportChecks by creating a **.sic.yml** file in the directory you wish to scan. 
This is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file that allows you to exclude paths, import statements and packages globally and also per target.
For example, if you need to: 
- exclude `.build` and `.github` paths from scanning
- exclude target `SomeTarget` from scanning
- exclude package `SomePackage` from scanning
- exclude `someInternalPath` only for `SICDemoApp` target from scanning
- exclude `SomeImport` import statements only for `SICDemoApp` target from scanning
- throw error when scan finds `STLT` import statement only for `SICDemoApp` target
```yaml
configurations:
  SICDemoApp:
    excluded:
      - someInternalPath
    excludedImports:
        - SomeImport
    forbiddenImports:
        - STLT
excludedPaths:
    - .build
    - .github
excludedTargets:
    - SomeTarget
excludedPackages:
    - SomePackage
```

## üöÄ Usage
```bash
swiftimportchecks -c ./.sic.yml -p MyProject.xcodeproj -s Packages
```
