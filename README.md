# üì¶ SwiftImportChecks

This is a tool that:
 - enforces only explicitly declared dependencies are imported. (Swift build provides the `--explicit-target-dependency-import-check` flag but unfortunatelly it is not available with `xcodebuild`.)
 - enforces extra rules for forbidden import statements per target.
 - throws errors when you have duplicate dependencies inside Package.swift files.
 - Can create a nice mermaid diagram for your local packages adding some extra config properties.

## üí° Suggestion

- Use the above tool as a pre-commit hook to avoid increasing your build time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Instalation

```bash
brew tap michaelversus/swiftimportchecks https://github.com/michaelversus/SwiftImportChecks
brew install swiftimportchecks
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command line flags
- `-c` lets you specify a path to your .sic.yml configuration file, if you have one
- `-r` sets the path SwiftImportChecks should scan. This defaults to your current working directory.
- `-p` sets the name of your project file (for example MyProject.xcodeproj), if you need one
- `-s` sets the path for a container for your local SPM Packages, if you want to parse those
- `-v` enables verbose output. Default value is false

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
You can customize the behavior of SwiftImportChecks by creating a **.sic.yml** file in the directory you wish to scan. 
This is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file that allows you to exclude paths, import statements and packages globally and also per target.
For example, if you need to: 
- exclude `.build` and `.github` paths from scanning
- exclude target `SomeTarget` from scanning
- exclude package `SomePackage` from scanning
- exclude `someInternalPath` only for `SICDemoApp` target from scanning
- exclude `SomeImport` import statements only for `SICDemoApp` target from scanning
- throw error when scan finds `STLT` import statement only for `SICDemoApp` target
- create a mermaid diagram for all your local packages
```yaml
configurations:
  SICDemoApp:
    excluded:
      - someInternalPath
    excludedImports:
        - SomeImport
    forbiddenImports:
        - STLT
excludedPaths:
    - .build
    - .github
excludedTargets:
    - SomeTarget
excludedPackages:
    - SomePackage
diagrams:
    regular:
        layers:
            - Foundation
            - Framework
```

## üöÄ Usage
```bash
swiftimportchecks -c ./.sic.yml -p MyProject.xcodeproj -s Packages
```

## Diagrams guide
SwiftImportChecks can generate a mermaid diagram for your local packages if you follow the below steps:
- Add the `diagrams` property in your .sic.yml file like demonstrated above with the `regular` property and some layers ordered from bottom to top.
- You need to add comments at the top of your local package files like this:
```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

// this comment will add ExampleModule inside the Foundation layer
// swiftimportchecks:0:ExampleModule

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ExamplePackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/jpsim/Yams.git", from: "5.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "ExampleModule", dependencies: ["Yams"]),
    ]
)
```
```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

// this comment will add OtherModule inside the Framework layer
// swiftimportchecks:1:OtherModule

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "OtherPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/jpsim/Yams.git", from: "5.0.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "OtherModule", dependencies: ["Yams"]),
    ]
)
```
The above example will create a diagram like this one inside the local packages directory:
